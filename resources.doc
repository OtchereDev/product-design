Usability Testing
The key for a test is the planning the tasks you want people to perform. How does a task look like? E.g:
"You need to look for a course about programming. How would you go about that?" > and then you see how the person tries to find a course. You need to observe them doing it and you can ask them to talk through and vocalize what are they doing or thinking, so you will have more insight. Very important is: never suggest them, even if they struggle! ;) leave them 3 attempts and, if they don't manage, you will show them how it works. Same process for all the other tasks.
When you begin the test, you might want to ask them what is the website about - what do they think is the service about, so you can capture if, from a first look to the landing page, is clear to them.
Write down all the tasks for all the features you want to investigate. 
I suggest you to use a spreadsheet (e.g. excel, it will help you keep everything clean) and write down answers there for each person (questions in columns, rows for people, with 1 row = 1 person).
I'll also upload a short guide here I wrote for a colleague with advices on how to conduct the usability tests.

UX & Design Thinking free beginners courses
I suggest you to take at least one beginner course in UX Design or Design Thinking, it will help you a lot understanding the framework, even if one day someone else will do UX in your team.
You will gain more control over the topic and complement your knowledge with the UX part, helping you both moving yourself in this world and interacting with UXers.
